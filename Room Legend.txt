Enemies+auras room:
the room contains randomly placed "Auras" and enemies. Upon passing through an aura, the enemy changes colors, and each color represents a unique behaviour pattern. utilizing these behaviour patterns, the player must make the enemies simultaneously activate all switches in the room
behaviours:
walk towards the player
walk away from the player
move same direction as player
move opposite direction from player
perhaps more

"Lights Out" room:
The classic "Lights out" puzzle. All switches are initially set to lit or unlit and toggling one also toggles all adjacent switches. turn all the switches on to complete the room
-to generate, simply start with all lights off and apply a random binary matrix of operations
